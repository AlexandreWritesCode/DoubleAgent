# Objective
As a counter-intelligence agency, we have found the locations of 150 double-agent spies. The problem is, we need a way to visualize them on a map. Your mission (if you are willing to accept it) is to visualize this data on a map for each of the double-agents.  This interface will be used by our team to assist in removing these double-agents.
